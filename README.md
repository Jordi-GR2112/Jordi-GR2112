Hello! 

I'm Jordi Gonzalez (@Jordi-GR2112) and I'm an Unity Developer. 

My main focus is to develop game and virtual experiences that engage people and to hone my skills on game development. 

I'm currently working on small/arcade games to improve my programming abilities and my knowledge with game engines.
