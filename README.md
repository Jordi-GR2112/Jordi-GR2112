Hello! 

I'm Jordi Gonzalez (@Jordi-GR2112) and I'm an Unity Developer with 4+ years of experience. 

My main focus is to hone my skills in game development by creating videogames and VR experiences that engage people and learn new technologies to enrich my knowledge. 

Currently working on several casual mobile games.
